A quick **"oh cool"** before we start:

## Let's outline some things


### ["...application of .. progressive overload..."](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7425879/)

tl;dr Progressive overload i.e. "harder than last time", may it be in plain intensity,
duration, or even weekly volume still matters.

Both meeting yourself where you are at that moment in time, and challenge
yourself; they equally do carry over to every type of activity, so be kind to
you, and be kind to tomorrow you. cool let's keep that up. `^_^`

### ["Some cool resource for maths people"](https://fellrnr.com/wiki/Main_Page)

tl;dr cool we can maths up a representation of our average
work, and either match or press it based upon data, and maybe even glean what
activities may hender our progress, so we can leave that ego at the door, and
be optimal.

So back to the prior, this things such as ["Modeling Human Performance"](https://fellrnr.com/wiki/Modeling_Human_Performance)
made it more easy for me to assess weekly "mileage" in a few ways, allows
finding a balance and challenge pretty swish.

Also knowing ["training Monotony is not about boredom..."](https://fellrnr.com/wiki/Training_Monotony)
would have helped me better plan variety and compare week to week if I knew how to do this better me-thinks.

## So what are we supporting even?

Sort of glad you asked `^_^` I don't really know how to best answer that besides
the blunt "be present". I have things to do, and a lot of folks I adore; so I
guess that's why I do this and other stuff too.

## Okay we need operational perams now ma'am, can you please hurry up with those?

tl;dr _moderate aerobic activity_: _150min a week plus begins to show you some benefit,_ ... _300min is also reported to do more;_ ... _if_ you're doing _light_activities_ _(_ rather than _[Z2](https://www.heart.org/en/healthy-living/fitness/fitness-basics/target-heart-rates)_ heart rate _)_, _double it_

To support this please find the following:

* [Some guidelines for physical activity in everybody](https://www.heart.org/en/healthy-living/fitness/fitness-basics/aha-recs-for-physical-activity-in-adults)
* [Some more guidelines for physical activity, but this one is particular to _"grown folk"_](https://www.nhs.uk/live-well/exercise/exercise-guidelines/physical-activity-guidelines-for-adults-aged-19-to-64/)

### You alluded to "benefits", what are you on about even?

So literature indicates through empirical testing, you'll likely get improved
cardiac fitness, and some folks self report better coping with physical and mental
health; cool. Right?

My anecdotal takeaway: comprehensive care of my health and well-being is one of
the many coping mechanisms I leverage to get through this weird thing we call
existing. Mental health is hard, and staying active is a thing from within me
that only I need to contribute to for it to be impactful; luckily it's in a
positive way too, or kind healthcare professionals would probably have my head.

## The goal of giving you this

* I want to provide you with the information to both support a choice, and a
    means to kindly exploit your body for great good that has the possibility to
    impact your days for the _better_.
* I hope you'll have resources to support your growing intrigue
* I hope to provide strong reason why just meeting yourself where you are each
    day and doing something that might sound hard can become a habit, and one
    worth cultivating

## One key takeaway

## Other things I'd love to talk with you about

Really, I can ramble a bit, if you like to gab here are some things that came to
mind.

* Being one step from an _au pai_ in the 2000's.
* How to make your community feel less disenfranchised in politics; regardless of
    their ethics, morals, and activities; reminding them to research and vote
    their conscience always works well; want to hear how I never get  yelled
    at?
    * tl;dr "vote conscience, idk what you do; here resources research
        voting records and keep 'em accountable they are your employee".
